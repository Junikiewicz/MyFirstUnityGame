# MyFirstUnityGame

It's my first game created with Unity - action-rpg.

## Game background

You are evil-lord of the dungeon. You are tired of all those adventurers riding your dungeon for treasures. It's time for your revenge. 

## Graphics

I'm using free assets from the internet. I don't have too much choice so the game is certainly not looking as good as I would like to. It's really hard to get quality top-down sprites with all the animations.
