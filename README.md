# MyFirstUnityGame

It's my first game created with Unity - action-rpg. 

Current progress: https://youtu.be/MfI1yEX5cGQ 

# What have I learned so far

I always wanted to make a game, but I find it to be mostly an educational project. I started with very little knowledge of c# and almost no idea what unity is. It turned out to be very user-friendly, so I got used very quickly. Simultaneously, I started to read about good programming practices and I found about all that useful patterns. As my project grown I found that they are very important. I'm trying to make my newest scripts as clean as possible. I'm also refactoring some older scripts. I learned that dependencies are dangerous and should be thought out. My first step in that direction was to implement events. I really liked the idea that components don't know anything about each other. I'm sure that soon I will learn something new and my whole project will be turned upside down again.

# Explanation

I'm aware that it's not exactly how you should make games in Unity. A lot of changes that I'm doing in the code should be done in the inspector. This way, for example game designer would have an easier task. However, I started this as a project at the university. My teacher would prefer to see my code instead of admiring how good I am at inspector. I'm also aiming to improve my programming skills and I need to practise.

# Game background

You are evil-lord of the dungeon. You are tired of all those adventurers riding your dungeon for treasures. It's time for your revenge. 

# Graphics

I'm using free assets from the internet. I don't have too much choice so the game is certainly not looking as good as I would like to. It's really hard to get quality top-down sprites with all the animations. 

# TODO

I'm thinking about tower defence minigame (protecting your dungeon)

New enemy class: healer

Character development system (give the player choises on promotion)

Equipment sytem (potions).

Followers

Magic skills

Bosses

QTE

Bonus shrines (like in diablo)
