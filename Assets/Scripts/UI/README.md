# UI

All scripts here are mostly just displaying certain information to the player and therefore not have an impact on game logic. I used events to make sure that the UI and other components don't know anything about each other.

## MainMenu

Menu items are stored on stack. With this approach it's convenient to work with them. It's also quite easy to add extra ones to the game.

## InGameUI

I wanted to make it as modular as possible. Honestly, with events it's quite easy.
